# Super Crazy Bonus Release

Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful?
  - good for setting default value

2. What is the disadvantage of single inheritance, and what's a possible solution to that problem?
  - You might inherit undesired traits

3. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash?
  - Readability and easy to configure

4. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable?
  - private allows methods to be kept in its own class (to be used within itself only)

5. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future?
  - These concepts allows the program/code to be read and modified more easily. Errors are going to be singled out and etc. It is also easier to build rspec to test simpler methods.
