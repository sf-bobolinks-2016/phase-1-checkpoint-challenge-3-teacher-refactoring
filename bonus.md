# Super Crazy Bonus Release

Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful?
	This is useful when data or number of arguments passed into the parameter are dynamic. The program would throw an error if there's more or less arguments than specified by the parameters. Hash fetch will set a default value if no value is initially given.

2. What is the disadvantage of single inheritance, and what's a possible solution to that problem?
	The disadvantage of single inheritance is that the classes are tightly coupled, meaning that changes to one will likely mean changes to the others inheriting.

3. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash?
	This is useful when data or number of arguments passed into the parameter are dynamic.


4. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable?
	Private allows access to all methods below private for specific uses where these methods should not be accessible at class scope at all times?

5. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future?
	These concepts are important for readabiity. Other programmers will have to read the code base that you created at some point, so abstracting code into smaller, single responsibility classes, etc, will make someones life easier in the future. Personally, I have seen advantages such as quicker access to methods associated with certain actions.
