# Super Crazy Bonus Release

Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful?

- Hash.fetch is useful because you can set a default value to your key if none exist.

2. What is the disadvantage of single inheritance, and what's a possible solution to that problem?

3. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash?

They are initialized with a hash so that is easier to store access key value matches.

4. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable?

 you can't call private methods outside of the class scope. Protects you from information that might be sensitive such as bank accounts or social securities.

5. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future?

single responsibility gives a method one purpose. Its good practice to not have a method do too much for general readability.
