Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful?
*	Hash.fetch is useful because it returns the value of a given key.  If the key does not exist in the hash there are three options. first it will give an error message.  Scecond if given a defaul value to return it will return that value if the key is not found.  Third it can be given a block of code to be performed if the key is not in the hash.

2. What is the disadvantage of single inheritance, and what's a possible solution to that problem?
*	I think the disadvantage of single inheritance is the repetition of methods in some classes

3. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash?
*	for easier access of instance data, using the key, value pair.

4. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable?
*	private keyword block the outside access to the codes following the private keyword.  It will protect you from accessing wrong varibale, method, etc... from two or more places.

5. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future?
